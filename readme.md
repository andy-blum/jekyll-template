Background
==========
While traditional CMSs like Drupal, Wordpress, and Joomla offer extremely flexible & extensible backends for building powerful sites, they have a few trade-offs:
- Complexity beyond what a small business may need or be able to afford
- Security concerns stemming from modules/plugins and permissions
- Requires a server-side processing

A large number of smaller clients don't need much more than a handful static pages and a small number of syndicated content types, so we developed the Midnet EasyBake template to streamline the creation of sites for our clients that don't need the superior customization or functionality that the big-name CMSs provide.

Dependencies
============
#### Jekyll
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.
