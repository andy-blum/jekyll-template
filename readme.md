Background
==========
While traditional CMSs like Drupal, Wordpress, and Joomla offer extremely flexible & extensible backends for building powerful sites, they have a few trade-offs:
- Complexity beyond what a small business may need or be able to afford
- Security concerns stemming from modules/plugins and permissions
- Requires a server-side processing

A large number of smaller clients don't need much more than a handful static pages and a small number of syndicated content types, so we developed the Midnet EasyBake template to streamline the creation of sites for our clients that don't need the superior customization or functionality that the big-name CMSs provide.

Quickstart
==========
1) Fork this repository
2) Configure CMS settings
3) Customize SASS variables
4) Set up site with Netlify
5) Profit!

Dependencies
============
#### Jekyll
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

Documentation
=============

*It's important to note that this template is not for every project or every client.*

The EasyMake site is designed to get a functioning site up and running in **less than one day** by leveraging a CSS/JS component framework to create a site with a simple, intuitive CMS, templated pages, and minimal custom functionality.

It's also important to note that while this project utilizes a CMS, it does not have an upgrade path to a more extensible CMS like Drupal, Wordpress, or Joomla. If a site will *eventually* have high-end features such as e-commerce, it may be a better use of your time to build the site in another CMS.
